Other times, the function may be defined at a point, but it may approach a different limit.  There are many, many times where the function value is the same as the limit at a point.  Either way, this is a powerful tool as we start thinking about slope of a tangent line to a curve.\n"

"The truth is: we don't know, but we suspect\n"
"They're somewhere in those digits. And now I\n"
"Will show why we don't know if we're correct.\n"
"\n"
"You see, we think the digits do behave\n"
"As if they were a random sequence, and\n"
"So many mathematicians tried to brave\n"
"This question, but we still don't understand.\n"
"\n"
"Pi isn't random: each digit must be\n"
"Exactly what the definition states.\n"
"It's pseudo-random, far as we can see,\n"
"But it's the subject of intense debates.\n"
"\n"
"Now I'll explain, with this parameter:\n"
"It's all in iambic pentameter.\n"
"\n"
"You may have heard of this scenario:\n"
"A thousand monkeys type at keyboards 'till\n"
"They write the works of Shakespeare. Even though,\n"

"That with a random and infinite set\n"
"Of letters, that eventu-ally you\n"
"Will find whatever words you want to get.\n"
"\n"
"However, on this thing you can depend:\n"
"Before you do, the universe will end.\n"

"9-1-3-7-5-2-2-8-ten\n"

"1-4-1-5. I guess the answer's \"no.\"\n"

"\n"

"You wouldn't know if you'd recovered it.\n"

"If you take any pattern of length Z\n"
"You'll definitely find the pattern there,\n"
"And others that length, with' same frequency.\n"
"\n"
"Length 1 would just be every digit, so\n"
"All digits happen infinity times.\n"
"And all two-digit numbers also go\n"
"In there somewhere. If you list all the primes,\n"
"\n"
"You get the Copeland-Erdos constant, which\n"
"Is one of few known normal numbers. Or\n"
"Take every number in order and stitch\n"
"Them all together. And we know there's more.\n"
"\n"
"Most numbers must be of the normal kind,\n"
"But somehow they are hard for us to find.\n"
"\n"

"We think that Pi is normal. Also e\n"
"And square root 2 and other stuff like that.\n"
"We don't know how to prove that they must be,\n"
"That Pi contains Macbeth where he's a cat.\n"

"Digits of every length, that will include\n"
"A Romeo and Juliet in love\n"
"Who meet in time and live and end the feud.\n"

"And since the strings of numbers must occur\n"
"With equal frequency to other strings\n"
"Of the same length, it don't matter whether\n"
"You choose this code or other permutings.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps somewhere Dog Hamlet and Catbeth\n"
"Are chillin', bustin' ghosts, avoiding death.\n"

"There's simple open problems about pi,\n"
"Like whether every digit, oh through nine,\n"
"Keeps happening. We can't figure out why\n"
"6 shouldn't stop appearing, down the line.\n"
"\n"
"It seems ridiculous, to think that 2\n"
"Occurs finitely many times. I fear,\n"
"That without proof, we can't say it's not true.\n"
"Alas, poor Yorick may never appear.\n"
"\n"
"But the exciting thing is that I think\n"
"These problems will be solved before too long.\n"
"And then this video will really stink\n"
"Because all this not-knowing will be wrong.\n"

"When the building, earlier on the site of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, was destroyed by fire during the Commune in 1871, plans were drawn up to replace it with a museum of decorative arts. Rodin won the competition to design a great set of doors for its entry way. Although the museum was never built, Rodin continued to work on the doors. They became an ongoing project; a grand stage for his sculptural ideas. It's fitting that the plaster of this great unfinished sculpture, The Gates of Hell, is now on display at the d'Orsay, the former railway terminal that was built on this site instead of the museum of decorative arts and that, by lovely coincidence, was converted into one of the world's great art museums."

"http://www.ted.com The news that Chinese artist Ai Weiwei has been detained by authorities has prompted significant concern here at  TED-HQ.  We had shown a film of him at last month's conference,  an unexpected and courageous statement about his treatment by the government, social change, the power of the web, and his hope for the future of China.   The film, which was shown as Ai Weiwei himself watched live over the web in the middle of the night, prompted a huge standing ovation from the TED audience. \n"

"TED is a non-partisan, nonpolitical organization and we understand  the Chinese authorities concern at anything which might provoke social unrest. But for anyone who believes in the power of ideas, of human imagination, it is heartbreaking to see one of the world's great artists shackled in this way.  We will be tracking developments carefully.  Here is the film."
